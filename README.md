The computer program, at the most fundamental level, brings about the connectivity between synapses and neurons of each anatomical region of the brain and the neurome(the anatomical regions aside from the brain that gives rise to neurological functionalities). It also brings about the connectivity of brain region to brain region. Moreover, the synapse and neuron connections are supposed to emulate neuromorphic or artificial synapse and neurons- hence the addition of Cmos Neuron and Memresistor Synapses, these produce a specific voltage or synaptic weight - put biologically - that output how each brain region and neurome metabolizes information.
